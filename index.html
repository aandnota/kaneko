					<h2>3D Design &amp; Fabrication</h2>
					<p>In the 3D Prototyping Camp we will focus on Computer-Aided Design (CAD), 3D Modeling, and 3D printing. Students will learn to design their own 3D models using programs like Tinker CAD and Sketchup. Campers will get a firm understanding of advanced science and technology concepts related to rapid-prototyping and learn first-hand how the technology is being used in art, design, medicine, and manufacturing. Participants will design, print, and take their creations home to share with friends and family.</p>
